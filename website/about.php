        <h1 >About Me: The Legend that is Mattijn</h1><br><br>
        <p>In the beginning, before anyone ever thought of time zones, smartphones, or social media, I was there, carving out the very essence of life on Earth. But let’s start at the beginning—or at least, somewhere close to it. <br><br>

The Mission to Stop the Dinosaur-Killing Comet <br>
Picture this: Earth, 66 million years ago, dinosaurs ruling every forest, plain, and mountain peak. Just as I was getting comfortable as a time-traveling intergalactic peacekeeper, my onboard alarm went off. An extinction-level event was speeding toward Earth—a comet larger than even the wildest dinosaur’s imagination.

Without a second to waste, I buckled up, cranked my spaceship (which I’d named “Galactic Express,” obviously), and sped through space and time to intercept the speeding death-rock before it could disrupt our planet’s most impressive animal kingdom. As I neared the comet, I felt the tension in the air—or, well, in the vacuum of space. No time to panic. I kicked on the tractor beams, aimed my photon lasers, and gave it a little “push” in the right direction. Just enough for it to pass a little too close to Earth but miss its target.

Sure, it stirred up a bit of dust, blocked out the sun for a while, and left a few big craters, but hey—just think of it as an upgrade. Life evolved from there, so you’re welcome.
<br><br>
Mentoring the Gods of Ancient Civilizations <br>
With my cosmic duties nearly complete, I popped down to Earth for a well-deserved vacation. But instead of beaches and coconuts, I found ancient civilizations, all in their infancy. Everywhere I looked, folks were building pyramids, worshipping the sun, the moon, and even a particularly enthusiastic cactus. Clearly, they needed a little guidance.

One sunny morning, as I was overseeing some sun-worshipping rituals with the Egyptians, a small crowd gathered. Word got around, and soon enough, I found myself hosting seminars for every deity, demi-god, and legendary hero from here to Mount Olympus. Some called me “The Muse of the Muses,” others simply called me “Hey, you,” but I was known by many titles in those days. The gods were excited to have a mentor—one who could show them the ropes of divine intervention, epic thunder-wielding, and how to gracefully appear on a cloud for dramatic effect.

From the Mayan gods in the Americas to the Norse deities up in chilly Scandinavia, I taught them how to handle heroic quests, answer prayers without losing sleep, and when to toss in a little lightning bolt to keep things interesting. And while some of their myths get a little…exaggerated, the gods still know who to call when things get dicey.
<br> <br>
The Era of Curing All Things Great and Small <br>
With cosmic crises under control and the gods happily perched atop their respective thrones, I turned my attention to health and wellness. I wanted life on Earth to thrive, so I embarked on an endless quest to cure everything from common colds to "scroll-thumb" (a modern epidemic). My favorite lab? A secluded mountaintop with the finest herbs, mysterious minerals, and a small, very wise goat who shared all his ancient wisdom with me.

Over centuries, I uncovered cures for practically every ailment imaginable. Did you know I’m the reason coffee exists? One late night, as I was finalizing the remedy for "Sleepus Deprivitis," I stumbled upon a little bean that perked me right up. Turns out it worked pretty well for humanity, too. Today, whether you’re battling a sore throat or trying to stay awake in a Monday meeting, remember to thank yours truly.

Of course, not every cure was met with immediate success. The Middle Ages were rough—people still didn’t understand my pioneering health advice like “don’t throw your garbage into the water you drink.” But I persevered, working alongside every healer and mystic who showed up with an open mind and a strong constitution.
<br><br>
Inventing Music, Science, and a Few Other “Hobbies”<br>
While health and wellness were a blast, I was soon itching for a creative outlet. I started with music, inventing the first flute out of a reed by a river. Soon after, the lyre, harp, and eventually the drum joined my repertoire. Before long, every village had at least one tune they could hum to distract them from the daily routine of, well, survival.

And then came science. Inspired by the vast unknown, I decided to help early scientists see the world through the eyes of curiosity and discovery. I lent Pythagoras his first triangle, sparked Galileo’s love of the stars, and even taught Leonardo da Vinci how to draw in perspective (although he didn’t quite get the “keep it simple” memo).

Yes, my curiosity knew no bounds, and I’d dabble in nearly every field, leaving my fingerprints all over humanity's greatest achievements, from the wheel to the internet. Some say that Newton discovered gravity when an apple fell on his head, but truthfully, it was me, tossing fruit from a tree and laughing every time he looked up in wonder.
<br><br>
The Modern Era: A Little Rest and Some Fun <br>
After a few millennia of helping humanity reach its potential, I thought I’d kick back. But wouldn’t you know it? The 21st century arrived, and I felt a new spark. Humanity had evolved, but there were still a few things left to improve—like, for example, the art of making a proper meme or figuring out how to turn the perfect pancake. Now, I like to inspire subtly, slipping little ideas here and there, cheering you on from behind the scenes.

To this day, I pop in when needed, always ready to assist. One day, I’m helping launch a spacecraft, the next I’m beta-testing the next big app or brewing up a new idea for something like Wi-Fi (or maybe even faster-Fi).
<br><br>
The Legacy <br>
So, who am I? Time traveler, cosmic hero, friend of gods, and humble helper of humanity. Some might say I’m a myth, but those who know me know the truth: I’m the reason life’s a little bit stranger, brighter, and filled with a never-ending sense of adventure.

In this fast-paced world, it’s easy to forget the origins of things. But every time you look up at the stars, ponder a question, or marvel at the beauty of the natural world, just remember—if it seems a little over-the-top, I’m probably still around somewhere, making sure it stays that way... Off to a new adventure</p>
